# gutiar-database-webite

This website is for my Advanced Higher Computing project. The website connects to an database and selects information from the database and sends to the website and also inserts data from the website to the database.

You can log your owned guitars, and can view users owned guitars.

To run this, open terminal and cd to your local server html files, then type:

<code>$ git clone https://github.com/petertasker/guitar-web.git</code>


You can view changes using: <code>$ git status </code>
